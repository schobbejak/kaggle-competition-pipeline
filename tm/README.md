# Trained models folder

The "Trained models" folder is a directory that contains the trained models for the Kaggle competition pipeline project. This folder is used to store the machine learning models that have been trained on the provided dataset. These models can be used for making predictions on new data or evaluating the performance of the trained models.

To use the models in this folder, you can load them into your code using a machine learning library or framework of your choice. Once loaded, you can use the models to make predictions on new data by passing the input data through the trained model and obtaining the output predictions.

It is important to keep this folder organized and well-documented, as it allows for easy access and reuse of the trained models. Additionally, it is recommended to version control the models in this folder to track changes and ensure reproducibility of the results.
